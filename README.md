# FlashFloodDetection
A simple web application designed for Flash flood detection. 
 
The registered users will receive alerts when there is a possibility for a flood in their locale (predicted based on sensor data).
Users can also have live insights over the data (parameters or sensor readings taken on water current). 
This application is a part of the entire project we did in our university.
